# Stealthlogger
StealthLogger is an advanced keylogger that offers comprehensive and discrete keystroke monitoring on targeted systems. This powerful tool operates stealthily in the background, capturing each key pressed by the user without their knowledge.

With its sophisticated logging capabilities, StealthLogger records not only the keys themselves but also the context in which they were typed. It captures keystrokes from various input sources, including keyboards, virtual keyboards, and on-screen keyboards. This ensures that no matter how the user interacts with the system, their input will be meticulously logged.

StealthLogger goes beyond basic keylogging functionality by offering additional features. It can capture screenshots at regular intervals, providing a visual record of the user's activities. Furthermore, it can monitor clipboard activity, capturing copied text and files, as well as track application usage and web browsing history.

The captured data is stored securely in encrypted files, protecting it from unauthorized access. StealthLogger offers multiple options for remote data retrieval, including email delivery or remote server storage, allowing you to access the logged information from anywhere.

It is essential to note that the use of StealthLogger for unauthorized monitoring or invasion of privacy is highly unethical and illegal. Respect for privacy and adherence to legal regulations are crucial in maintaining ethical boundaries.

Python Installation: Ensure that Python is installed on your Linux system. Most Linux distributions come pre-installed with Python. If not, you can install it using the package manager specific to your distribution.

Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries, such as keyboard and smtplib, which are used for keylogging and email functionality, respectively. You can use the package manager or the Python package installer pip to install these libraries.

Code Modification: The code provided earlier is compatible with Linux, but you might need to make some adjustments depending on your specific Linux distribution or any additional security measures in place. Ensure that the email settings are properly configured with valid email credentials and recipient information.

Execution: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you have saved the StealthLogger Python script, and execute it using the Python interpreter. You can use the command python3 stealthlogger.py if you have Python 3 installed.

Monitoring: Once the keylogger is running, it will silently capture keystrokes, store them in a log file, and send them via email as per your configuration. You can leave the keylogger running in the background while it continuously records the desired activity.

Remember that using StealthLogger or any similar tool for unauthorized monitoring or invading someone's privacy is highly unethical and illegal. Always respect privacy rights and adhere to legal regulations.
