# Stealthlogger
StealthLogger is an advanced keylogger that offers comprehensive and discrete keystroke monitoring on targeted systems. This powerful tool operates stealthily in the background, capturing each key pressed by the user without their knowledge.

With its sophisticated logging capabilities, StealthLogger records not only the keys themselves but also the context in which they were typed. It captures keystrokes from various input sources, including keyboards, virtual keyboards, and on-screen keyboards. This ensures that no matter how the user interacts with the system, their input will be meticulously logged.

StealthLogger goes beyond basic keylogging functionality by offering additional features. It can capture screenshots at regular intervals, providing a visual record of the user's activities. Furthermore, it can monitor clipboard activity, capturing copied text and files, as well as track application usage and web browsing history.

The captured data is stored securely in encrypted files, protecting it from unauthorized access. StealthLogger offers multiple options for remote data retrieval, including email delivery or remote server storage, allowing you to access the logged information from anywhere.

It is essential to note that the use of StealthLogger for unauthorized monitoring or invasion of privacy is highly unethical and illegal. Respect for privacy and adherence to legal regulations are crucial in maintaining ethical boundaries.
